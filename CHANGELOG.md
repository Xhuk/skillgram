# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — first public release

One skill hub for every coding agent. Links only: skillgram never copies, adopts,
moves or deletes the skills an agent already has.

**Hub**
- `sync` (idempotent: create missing links, repoint wrong ones, drop dead ones), `status`, `watch`, `daemon`, `install-autostart`.
- `doctor`: installed harnesses, native skills per agent, name collisions, dead/missing links.
- `onboard`: detect every installed harness, ask "all or just this one?", consolidate with the connected LLM.
- `adopt`: cooperative adoption (copy → verify hash → quarantine the original → leave a link).

**Project scope (engram-style)**
- `init`, `use`, `unuse`, `project-status`, `mount` (project-only view across 13 harness layouts).
- Resolution order: `--project` → `SKILLGRAM_PROJECT` → nearest `.agents/config.json` up to the git root → cwd.
- `mount --apply` also injects the skillgram protocol into `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`.

**LLM, explicitly**
- `bootstrap`: repo signals → candidates → the LLM picks the set and reports gaps.
- `propose`: the LLM drafts a skill, `lint` gates it, then it is published and mounted.
- Every automatic decision is stamped `by: llm:<model>` and logged to `~/.agents/skillgram-llm.log`.

**Operations**
- `index` / `search` (FTS5), `missing` (deterministic "do we have something for this?"), `demand` (uncovered queries = roadmap).
- `review`, `pin`, `retire` (never deletes: `<hub>/_retired/` + tombstones).
- `export` / `import` (tar.gz with a hash manifest), `diff` (divergence between two copies), `git` (hub as a repo: status/init/pull/push).
- `mcp` (stdio JSON-RPC, 5 tools) and `mcp --read-only`.

**Surface**: English CLI, English JSON keys, stdlib only (Python 3.9+), Windows-first with macOS/Linux symlinks.
